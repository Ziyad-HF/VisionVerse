# VisionVerse

VisionVerse is a comprehensive repository showcasing various computer vision applications implemented using PyQt and Python. Each application focuses on different aspects of image processing, segmentation, and analysis.

## Applications

### 1. [Imagizer](https://github.com/AbdulrahmanGhitani/Imagizer): Image Processing Desktop Application

Imagizer is a PyQt-based desktop application designed for performing a variety of image processing tasks:
- Grayscale and color image manipulation
- Noise addition and filtering
- Edge detection using various algorithms
- Histogram analysis, normalization, and equalization
- Color to grayscale conversion and frequency domain filtering
- Hybrid image generation

### 2. [Snaky Detector](https://github.com/Zoz-HF/snaky-detector): Advanced Edge Detection Application

Snaky Detector utilizes powerful edge detection algorithms to analyze and process images:
- Active Contour (Snakes) for segmenting complex shapes with smooth edges
- Hough Transform for detecting lines and circles
- Canny Edge Detection for robust edge detection and image segmentation

### 3. [Image Descriptor](https://github.com/Zoz-HF/Image_Descriptor.git): Corner Detection and Feature Matching

Image Descriptor is a PyQt desktop application focusing on corner detection and feature extraction:
- Harris operator and Lambda minus methods for corner detection in grayscale and color images
- Feature extraction using Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
- Image matching techniques such as Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) and Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC)

### 4. [Segmentor](https://github.com/Zoz-HF/Segmentor): Thresholding and Segmentation Application

Segmentor is a PyQt application for performing thresholding and segmentation techniques:
- Optimal thresholding, Otsu's method, spectral thresholding, and local thresholding for grayscale images
- Unsupervised segmentation using k-means clustering, region growing, agglomerative clustering, and mean shift methods for both grayscale and color images

### 5. [Face Recognition System Application](https://github.com/omarshaban02/Face-Recognition-System)

A PyQt5 and OpenCV-based tool for real-time face detection and recognition:
- PCA-based face recognition model
- Attributes analysis including age, gender, and emotion using DeepFace
- User-friendly interface for interactive image processing and visualization
